# DeepCCZreview

This project contains code from both previously published and re-analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences and newly sequenced 16S amplicons for a review of bacterial and archaeal biodiversity in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Code covers 1) ASV generation and further QCing; 2) differential abundance analysis of ASVs using DESeq2; and 3) taxonomic reclassification of sequences from clone libraries.

The publication associated with this code is now available here:
